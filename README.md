# Claude Sandbox

A lightweight Docker sandbox for development — drop into an isolated shell at your current directory with all your host tools available. Optionally run [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` inside the container where the blast radius is limited by Docker.

## Why?

- **Sandboxed shell** — work inside a disposable container, not directly on your host
- **Zero build time** — mounts host binaries and libraries directly, no Docker image to build or maintain
- **Full tooling** — all host binaries in `/usr/bin` are available via `/host/bin`
- **Seamless auth** — shares your SSH keys, git config, and AWS credentials (read-only)

## Requirements

- Linux / WSL2
- Docker
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed on the host (`~/.local/bin/claude`) — only needed for the `yolo` command

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:aeanez/claude-sandbox.git
cd claude-sandbox
bash install.sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

Or manually — copy the function and aliases from [`claude-sandbox.sh`](claude-sandbox.sh) into your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
cat claude-sandbox.sh >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 2. Use

```bash
# Open an interactive shell inside the sandbox
sandbox

# Run Claude Code with --dangerously-skip-permissions inside the sandbox
yolo
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `sandbox` | Opens an interactive bash shell inside the container at your current directory |
| `yolo` | Runs `claude -c --dangerously-skip-permissions` inside the container (hostname: `yolo`) |

Inside the sandbox you have full access to `git`, `docker`, `ssh`, `jq`, `make`, and all other host binaries via `/host/bin`. You can also run `claude` manually from inside the shell.

## How is this different from Claude Code's `/sandbox`?

Claude Code has a built-in `/sandbox` command that uses OS-level isolation (bubblewrap on Linux, Seatbelt on macOS) to restrict what individual tool calls can access. It's a security feature that limits filesystem writes and filters network requests.

This repo is different — it wraps your **entire session** inside a Docker container:

| | Claude Code `/sandbox` | claude-sandbox (this repo) |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | Restricts individual Bash commands | Isolates the entire session |
| **Technology** | OS-level (bubblewrap / Seatbelt) | Docker container |
| **Filesystem** | Write-restricted to CWD + allowlist | Container boundary — only sees mounted paths |
| **Network** | Proxy-based domain allowlist | Host network (no filtering) |
| **Tools** | Some break (docker, watchman) | All host binaries available via `/host/bin` |
| **Use case** | Hardened security for autonomous agents | Dev workflow with full autonomy (`yolo`) |

The main value of `yolo` is running `--dangerously-skip-permissions` inside a disposable container where the blast radius is limited by Docker. You can also enable `/sandbox` *inside* the container for defense-in-depth.

## How It Works

   └─────────────────────────────┘
```

The container runs as your host user (same uid/gid), uses host networking, and mounts your entire home directory. The working directory matches wherever you launched the command from.

The container's prompt is overridden via `PROMPT_COMMAND` to show the container hostname (`sandbox` or `yolo`) regardless of your host's PS1 configuration.

## Configuration

### Base image

The default is `ubuntu:22.04` to match a typical WSL2 host. Change it in `claude-sandbox.sh` if your host runs a different distro.

### Hostname

The hostname defaults to `sandbox` and can be overridden via the `SANDBOX_HOSTNAME` environment variable. The `yolo` alias sets it to `yolo` automatically.

### Prompt

The container sets `PROMPT_COMMAND` to override PS1 with a colored prompt showing the hostname, working directory, and git branch. To customize it, edit the `PROMPT_COMMAND` env var in `claude-sandbox.sh`.

## Security Considerations

This sandbox limits blast radius via Docker, but it is **not a security boundary** against a determined attacker. Two things to be aware of:

- **Docker socket is mounted** — the container has full access to the Docker daemon, which is effectively root-equivalent on the host. This is required for the `docker` CLI to work inside the sandbox. If you don't need Docker access, remove the `-v /var/run/docker.sock` line.

- **`$HOME` is mounted read-write** but sensitive directories (`.ssh`, `.aws`, `.gnupg`) are overlaid as read-only by default. To protect additional paths, add more read-only overlays in `claude-sandbox.sh`:

```bash
-v "$HOME/.kube:$HOME/.kube:ro" \
```

For defense-in-depth, enable Claude Code's built-in `/sandbox` inside the container as well.

## Troubleshooting

### "No user exists for uid 1000"
SSH needs to resolve your user. The setup mounts `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` read-only to fix this.

### Claude asks for first-time setup
The installer handles this automatically. If it still happens, add `hasCompletedOnboarding: true` and `theme: "dark"` to `~/.claude/.claude.json`.

### Docker permission denied
The setup adds your user to the Docker socket's group via `--group-add`. If it still fails, check the socket permissions: `stat -c '%g' /var/run/docker.sock`.

### Tool not found
All host binaries from `/usr/bin` are mounted at `/host/bin` and added to `PATH`. If a binary lives elsewhere, add a `-v` mount for it in `claude-sandbox.sh`. Dynamically linked binaries work because `/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` and `/usr/lib` are mounted.
